# SOE
This is the Matlab code for the Switch Opening and Exchange (SOE) method used in paper "Switch Opening and Exchange Method for Stochastic Distribution Network Reconfiguration" that has been accepted by and will be published in IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid.

Before running the code, the path to the MatPower toolbox needs to be added. The MatPower can be downloaded from github.com/MATPOWER/matpower

The main code is 'decrese_reconfig_xxx_tabu.m' where 'xxx' is 33, 84, 119, 136, and 417 for the five test systems used in the paper. The main code for the brute-force search method used in the paper is 'brute_force_case33.m'
